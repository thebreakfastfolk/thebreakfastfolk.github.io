## The Breakfast Folk

The Breakfast Folk aims to provide an opportunity for anyone to participate in 
live folk music.

The idea came from a group of North-East folk musicians who due to family and 
work commitments were unable to attend the traditional evening pub-based 
sessions on a regular basis.

Saturday morning sessions allow parents and children alike the chance to 
participate.  The Breakfast Folk use community hall venues, aiming to provide 
accessible, friendly environments where people of all ages can experience and 
develop playing live folk music.  Other family members, friends and relatives 
are all welcome to come along, and for those who can’t play an instrument then 
come for a coffee and enjoy the music.

Folk music beginners can be put off attending live sessions for fear of not 
knowing the music.  The Breakfast Folk will make a core selection of tunes 
available through provision of sheet music on saturday morning, 
and [links](/tune-sets/) to internet sources on this website.  
Most of the arrangements
are sets of instrumental hornpipes, jigs, reels or airs played in one of the 
commonly used keys of A, G, D or E.  Typical folk instruments include fiddle, 
accordion, melodeon, whistle, flute, northumbrian pipes, guitar and mandolin, 
but any instrument would be welcomed and a song is always appreciated.

If you are learning an instrument and want to try out playing in public; if you
are an experienced musician who wants to learn folk; if you’re a folk musician
wanting to get back into playing; if you’re a parent who wants your children
to see live music; if you’re a child who wants to run around in a hall on a
saturday morning; if you’re anyone who wants to play folk music in a 
non-threatening environment; then this is the session for you.

If you’re really good and only want to play with similar standard players; if 
you get annoyed by background noise and roaming toddlers; if you only want to 
play irish reels at 100 mph; then this is not the session for you.

The Breakfast Folk is the antidote to the high-brow pub session, so why don’t 
you pop along this Saturday and kick-start your weekend with some live music!
