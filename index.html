        <p class="lead">
            The Breakfast Folk is an opportunity for anyone anywhere to
            participate in live folk music. <br/>
            The idea came from a group of North-east folk musicians who due to
            family commitments were unable to regularly attend the more
            traditional evening pub-based sessions. <br/>
            The saturday morning timing is therefore aimed at enabling young
            families and beginner musicians to play in a friendly environment
            and experience and develop playing
            live folk music. <br/>
        </p>
